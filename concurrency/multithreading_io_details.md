# Multithreading I/O Details

This document explains how the operating system efficiently handles I/O
operations in a multithreaded environment. It describes the roles of the kernel,
scheduler, and interrupts in managing blocked threads and ensuring
responsiveness.

**Summary**

When a thread performs I/O, it makes a system call, and the OS kernel takes
over. The kernel puts the thread in a wait queue and handles the I/O operation.
When the operation is complete, the hardware signals the kernel with an
interrupt. The kernel's interrupt handler wakes up the thread, and the scheduler
determines when it runs again. This process is preemptive from the thread's
perspective and relies on interrupts, not polling.

**The OS Does \*Not\* Generally Poll the Thread**

In typical blocking I/O, the OS doesn't continuously "poll" the thread to see if
the I/O operation is complete. Polling would be very inefficient, as it would
consume CPU time unnecessarily. Instead, the OS uses a more efficient approach
based on events and signaling.

**Here's a more detailed look at what happens:**

1.  **Thread Makes a System Call:** As we discussed, the Python thread (via the
    C code of the interpreter) makes a system call to initiate the I/O
    operation. Let's use `open()` and `read()` as examples.

2.  **Kernel Handles the System Call:** The OS kernel receives the system call.

    - **What is the Kernel?**

      - The kernel is the core of the operating system. It's the lowest level of
        software that has complete control over the system's hardware.

      - It manages essential resources like the CPU, memory, storage devices,
        and input/output devices.

      - The kernel provides a set of services to higher-level software (like the
        Python interpreter and your applications) through system calls.

      - It operates in a special privileged mode called "kernel mode," which
        allows it to execute instructions that user-level programs cannot. This
        protects the system's integrity. User-level programs, including the
        Python interpreter, run in 'user mode,' which has restricted access to
        hardware and system resources. The kernel operates in 'kernel mode,'
        which has full access. This separation prevents user programs from
        directly interfering with the OS or other programs.

      - **User Space vs. Kernel Space**:

        - User space is where applications (like your Python program) execute.
          They have limited access to system resources.

        - Kernel space is where the OS kernel executes. It has full access to
          hardware and all system resources.

        - A system call is the mechanism by which a process in user space
          requests a service from the kernel.

        - Example: When you call `open("my_file.txt", "r")` in Python, the
          CPython interpreter makes a `sys_open` system call to the kernel.

3.  **Setting up the Wait:**

    - `open()`: When a thread calls `open()`, the kernel might need to create a
      file descriptor (a unique identifier for the opened file) and set up any
      necessary data structures. This operation might involve checking file
      permissions, allocating resources, and updating the file system's internal
      tables. In many cases, `open()` might not block for a long time unless the
      file is on a slow device or there are resource contention issues.

    - `read()`: When a thread calls `read()`, the kernel needs to get the data
      from the file (which might be on disk). This is where the blocking
      happens. The kernel does the following:

      - It identifies the file to be read (using the file descriptor).

      - It determines the location of the data on disk (if it's not already in
        the disk cache).

      - It initiates the disk read operation (if necessary).

      - **Crucially, the kernel puts the thread into a "waiting" or "blocked"
        state.** It does \*not\* sit in a loop constantly checking if the data
        is ready.

4.  **Wait Queues:** The OS uses data structures called **wait queues** to
    manage threads that are waiting for specific events. When a thread is
    blocked on an I/O operation, the kernel adds that thread to the appropriate
    wait queue. For a `read()` operation, the thread might be added to a wait
    queue associated with the file descriptor or the disk device.

5.  **Device Interaction:**

    - For disk I/O, the kernel communicates with the disk controller. The disk
      controller performs the actual physical read operation.

    - For network I/O, the kernel interacts with the network interface card
      (NIC) to send or receive data packets.

6.  **Interrupts and Signaling:**

    - When the I/O operation is complete (e.g., the disk has read the data, the
      network packet has arrived), the hardware device (or another part of the
      system) signals the kernel. This signaling often happens through
      **hardware interrupts**.

    - **What are Interrupts?**

      - An **interrupt** is a signal to the CPU that an event has occurred that
        requires attention.

      - Hardware devices (like disk controllers, network cards, keyboards, etc.)
        generate interrupts to indicate that they have completed an operation or
        need service.

      - When the CPU receives an interrupt, it temporarily suspends its current
        activity (which could be running a thread) and transfers control to a
        special piece of code called an **interrupt handler** or **Interrupt
        Service Routine (ISR)** within the kernel.

      - Interrupts are a crucial mechanism for the OS to respond to asynchronous
        events efficiently. Without them, the CPU would have to constantly poll
        devices, wasting a huge amount of processing power.

      - Interrupts have priorities. Some interrupts are more urgent than others.
        The OS needs to handle urgent interrupts (like a power failure) very
        quickly.

    - An **interrupt handler** is a specific function within the kernel that is
      executed in response to a particular interrupt.

      - The interrupt handler identifies the device that caused the interrupt
        and the nature of the event (e.g., "disk read complete," "network packet
        received").

      - The interrupt handler performs the necessary actions to handle the
        event, such as transferring data from the device to memory,
        acknowledging the device, or updating system status.

      - Once the interrupt handler finishes, the kernel typically resumes the
        execution of the interrupted thread (or another thread, as determined by
        the scheduler).

7.  **Kernel Wakes Up the Thread:**

    - The interrupt handler in the kernel then identifies the thread(s) that
      were waiting for that specific event (by looking at the wait queue).

    - The kernel changes the state of the waiting thread from "blocked" to
      "ready" (or "runnable"). This means the thread is now eligible to be
      scheduled to run on the CPU.

    - The kernel also copies the data (if it was a read operation) from the
      kernel's buffers to the memory space of the waiting thread.

8.  **Scheduler Resumes the Thread:**

    - **What is the Scheduler?**

      - The **scheduler** is a component of the kernel that is responsible for
        deciding which ready thread should be running on the CPU at any given
        time.

      - It's a core part of the OS that enables multitasking and concurrency.

      - The scheduler uses various algorithms to allocate CPU time to different
        threads (and processes) in a fair and efficient manner.

      - **Scheduling Algorithms:** Common scheduling algorithms include:

        - **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS):** Simplest algorithm; threads are
          executed in the order they arrive.

        - **Shortest Job First (SJF):** Tries to minimize waiting time by
          running the shortest thread first.

        - **Priority Scheduling:** Assigns priorities to threads and runs the
          highest-priority thread first.

        - **Round Robin:** Gives each thread a small time slice of CPU time,
          creating the illusion of parallel execution.

        - **Multilevel Queue Scheduling:** Divides threads into multiple queues
          with different priorities and scheduling algorithms.

      - The scheduler takes into account factors like thread priority, how long
        a thread has been waiting, and whether a thread is I/O-bound or
        CPU-bound when making its decisions.

      - The scheduler is invoked frequently by the kernel, such as when:

        - A thread blocks (e.g., for I/O).

        - An interrupt occurs.

        - A thread's time slice expires.

        - A thread is created or terminates.

      - **Context Switching**:

        - When the scheduler decides to switch from one thread to another, it
          performs a **context switch**.

        - This involves saving the state of the current thread (registers,
          program counter, stack pointer, etc.) and restoring the state of the
          thread to be run.

        - Context switching allows the CPU to efficiently switch between
          multiple threads, giving the illusion of parallel execution.

    - The OS scheduler, which is responsible for deciding which ready thread
      gets to run, eventually selects the thread that was previously blocked on
      I/O. This process of the scheduler switching the CPU from one thread to
      another is called 'context switching.' It involves saving the state of the
      current thread (registers, program counter, etc.) and loading the saved
      state of the next thread. Context switching has some overhead, but it's
      essential for multitasking.

    - The thread resumes execution from where it left off, after the `read()`
      system call.

**How it all works together:**

1.  A thread in your Python program makes a system call (e.g., `read()`). For
    the `read()` function, the Python interpreter makes a system call, such as
    `sys_read()` on Linux or `ReadFile()` on Windows.

2.  The kernel, the core of the OS, handles this call.

3.  The kernel initiates the I/O operation and puts the thread in a wait queue.

4.  The hardware device completes the I/O and sends an interrupt to the CPU.

5.  The kernel's interrupt handler processes the interrupt, moves the thread
    from the wait queue to the ready queue, and copies the data.

6.  The kernel's scheduler selects the ready thread to run on the CPU.

7.  The thread continues its execution.

**Key Points:**

- The OS uses **wait queues** to keep track of threads waiting for I/O.

- The OS does \*not\* poll the thread. Instead, it relies on **interrupts** from
  hardware devices to signal the completion of I/O operations.

- **Interrupts** are signals to the CPU that require attention, and they are
  handled by **interrupt handlers** in the kernel.

- When an I/O operation is complete, the kernel's interrupt handler **wakes up**
  the waiting thread and makes it eligible to run again.

- The **scheduler** is the kernel component that chooses which ready thread to
  run on the CPU, using various scheduling algorithms. The scheduler is invoked
  after the interrupt handler finishes its job.

- The OS scheduler then **preemptively** schedules the thread to run on the CPU.

- From the Python thread's viewpoint, the blocking and unblocking during I/O are
  largely handled by the OS without explicit cooperative action needed in the
  Python code (beyond making the initial I/O call).

**Analogy:**

Imagine a thread needs to read data from a file on a hard drive. The thread is
like a process asking the operating system (the librarian) for the data. The
hard drive is like the library's stacks, and the data is the book.

- You (the thread) give the librarian (the OS kernel) the request.

- The librarian (the OS kernel) doesn't stand there and ask you every second,
  "Are you ready for the book yet?" (polling).

- Instead, the librarian puts your name on a list (the wait queue) and goes to
  get the book.

- When the librarian finds the book, they ring a bell (the interrupt).

- The librarian (interrupt handler) checks the list (wait queue), sees your
  name, and tells you the book is ready.

- The head librarian (scheduler) decides when you can go to the counter to get
  the book (which thread runs next).

- You then go to the counter and get the book.

This analogy illustrates that the OS uses a more event-driven, interrupt-based
approach rather than polling.
